# Feliz [![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Feliz.svg?maxAge=0&colorB=brightgreen)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Feliz) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/yqinhayy1pgfcubp/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Zaid-Ajaj/feliz/branch/master)

A fresh retake of the base React DSL to build React applications, optimized for happiness.

Here is how it looks like:

```fs
module App

open Feliz

[<ReactComponent>]
let Counter() =
    let (count, setCount) = React.useState(0)
    Html.div [
        Html.button [
            prop.style [ style.marginRight 5 ]
            prop.onClick (fun _ -> setCount(count + 1))
            prop.text "Increment"
        ]

        Html.button [
            prop.style [ style.marginLeft 5 ]
            prop.onClick (fun _ -> setCount(count - 1))
            prop.text "Decrement"
        ]

        Html.h1 count
    ]

open Browser.Dom

ReactDOM.render(Counter(), document.getElementById "root")
```

### Features

 - Consistent, lightweight **formatting**: no more awkward indentation using two lists for every element.
 - Discoverable **attributes** with no more functions, `Html` attributes or css properties globally available so they are easy to find.
 - Proper **documentation**: each attribute and CSS property
 - Full **React API** support: Feliz aims to support the React API for building components using hooks, context and more.
 - Fully **Type-safe**: no more `Margin of obj` but instead utilizing a plethora of overloaded functions to account for the overloaded nature of `CSS` attributes, covering 90%+ of the CSS styles, values and properties.
 - Included **color list** of most commonly used `Html` colors in the `colors` module.
 - **Compatible** with the current DSL used in applications.
 - **Compatible** with [Femto](https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj/Femto).
 - Approximately **Zero** bundle size increase where everything function body is erased from the generated javascript unless you actually use said function.
